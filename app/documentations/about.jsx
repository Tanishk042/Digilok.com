        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Instead of the traditional models of family-owned, corporate-funded and controlled or advertising-driven 
            newspapers, magazines and TV channels, we reimagine the media as a joint venture in the public space 
            between journalists, readers and a concerned citizenry. One in which decisions about what to cover and how, 
            who to hire and where to send a correspondent or photographer, are taken by editors on the basis of 
            professional judgment, without worrying about what a proprietor or politician, official or advertiser might think or want.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a democracy, this is the least that readers or viewers expect. And yet, the business model that underpins 
            most Indian news media seldom allows editors the freedom they need. Worse, it has slowly eroded professional 
            standards of reporting and contributed to a media ecosystem rife with underhand practices: The rampant 
            editorializing, paid news and private treaties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Increasingly, media houses are reluctant to spend money on news-gathering; and as they develop secondary 
            business interests such as real estate, their newsrooms shrink, even as corporate owners grow closer to 
            political parties and politicians. Is it any wonder that readers have begun to debate the erosion of 
            professional standards, ethical breaches and fall in quality?
          </p>
          <p>
            The founding premise of our platform is that if good journalism is to survive and thrive, it can only do so 
            by being both editorially and financially independent. This means relying principally on contributions from 
            readers and concerned citizens who have no interest other than to sustain a space for quality journalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a publication, we are firmly committed to the public interest and democratic values. Apart from providing 
            authoritative analysis and commentary, we aim to grow as a platform buoyed by good old-fashioned reporting 
            on issues of national and international importance and interest. Being on the web also means using new media 
            technologies to change the way stories are told. With the current internet culture, video and audio are 
            integral parts of the narrative structure when warranted.
